This is a Flutter Android app project. The app consists of:

- HomePage: shows a logo and a button to open the Products page.
- Products Page: lists mobile phones, allows adding to cart, and shows a shopping cart icon with cart contents.
- Checkout Page: allows confirming/removing products and shows an order confirmation message.

Use modern Flutter best practices and keep UI clean and mobile-friendly.
